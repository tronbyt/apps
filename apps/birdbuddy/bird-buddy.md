Bird Buddy

Use this API as a reference
https://github.com/jhansche/pybirdbuddy

Implement a small API to fetch data from the "unofficial" bird buddy api above.
It should list the Last Bird who Visited the feeder along with the Date Time.

There should be a pixel bird on the screen

If a Bird was spotted in the last hour add a small animated music note

The app needs to configure the username and password field for authentication
