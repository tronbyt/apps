# On [The] Air for Tidbyt

Displays an old time radio station "On Air" sign. This variation can handle miultiple variations on the text. 

You are able to turn the sign "on" or "off," as well as hide it through the options. Same as the "On Air" sign. But there is also an alternative version where the sign says "On The Air." And even the ability to add custom text. Including aligning that text. If the text gets a little long it will wrap, so a full sentence is possible. There _are_ limits so try to keep it short. 

A spin off of Robert Ison's "On Air" app.

The primary catalyst for this spin off was to use [TronbytAssistant](https://github.com/tronbyt/TronbytAssistant) to automatically update the app. Manually flipping options is not an option for me. Testing of this connection is still ongoing.
