# On [The] Air for Tidbyt

Displays an old time radio station "On Air" sign. 

Turning the "On Air" sign on or off is done by editing your settings in the Tidbyt App itself. When you are not "On Air" you can hide the app from the rotation, or display an 'unlit' version of the "On Air" sign.

A spin off of Robert Ison's "On Air" app.
